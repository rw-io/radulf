# Troubleshooting

Radulf reports failures as text: an **exit reason** on the run, shown on the card
when it lands in **Needs Attention**, or an error banner in the UI. This page is
keyed on those strings — find the one you were given, in the section for the
stage it came from.

The long explanations live elsewhere; this page links out rather than restating
them.

## Starting a run

**`sandbox unavailable: …`**
The sandbox is enabled but the runtime is not usable on this machine, and Radulf
refuses to fall back to an unsandboxed run silently. The text after the colon is
the preflight's own list — see the two entries below for what it usually says.
The check runs at server boot and is cached, so restart Radulf after fixing it.

**`unsupported platform for sandboxing: <platform>`**
`sandboxEnabled` requires macOS or Linux (including WSL2). Native Windows and
WSL1 are not supported.

**`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1 …`**
The Ubuntu 24.04+ AppArmor default blocks bubblewrap's unprivileged user
namespace. Grant `bwrap` the `userns` capability via an AppArmor profile, or set
the sysctl to `0`, then restart Radulf. Note that Linux is
[best-effort](SANDBOXING.md) — not release-verified.

**`RADULF_AUTH_SECRET is not set`**
Authentication is on but the signing secret is missing. See
[Authentication](AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Providers and models

Radulf preflights the provider before the first iteration rather than
discovering the problem mid-run, so these fail fast.

**`loop provider unreachable: …`**
The loop's provider did not answer. The suffix is the underlying error —
`cannot reach <provider>` for a connection failure, or `<provider> responded
<status>` for an HTTP error.

**`no model selected for the OpenRouter provider — pick one in Settings`**
OpenRouter has no default model; unlike the subscription providers it needs an
explicit model id. See [Providers and models](PROVIDERS.md#configuring-a-role).

**`no model selected for the local provider: …` / `no models available from oMLX`**
No model was configured and the local server offered none to fall back on. It
must already be running and reachable at the configured base URL (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`), and the model must be tool-capable.

**`OpenRouter does not serve model "…"` / `the local endpoint does not serve model "…"`**
The model id is not one that provider offers. Check it against the provider's
own model list; the local endpoint's error names everything it is serving.

**`set your OpenRouter API key in Settings first`**
Exactly that — the key is stored in Settings, not in the environment.

**The app says no models are available for a subscription provider.**
Almost always the agent-directory mistake: pi writes `auth.json` wherever
`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` points, defaulting to `~/.pi/agent/`, and Radulf only ever
reads `data/pi-agent/`. Running `pi` from your own shell authenticates the wrong
directory. Use `make login` — that is what the target is for. See
[Providers and models](PROVIDERS.md#the-five-providers).

## A card in Needs Attention

Every one of these leaves the worktree intact. You can edit the card or its
plan and restart it, send it back to Backlog, or abandon it.

**`timeout`**
The run hit its wall-clock budget (default 60 minutes, overridable per card).

**`iteration-timeout`**
Two iterations in the run exceeded the per-iteration hard timeout. One timeout
is retried with the worktree preserved; the second ends the run, whatever
happened in between. A timed-out iteration keeps whatever it finished: if it
wrote `.ralph/ITERATION_DONE` before it was killed, the task is ticked and
committed exactly as on a clean ending, and the retry moves on to the next
task rather than redoing work already on disk.

**`stalled`**
Three consecutive iterations changed nothing — no checklist progress and no
work product. Usually the loop is stuck on a task it cannot express as a file
change, which is a plan problem more often than a model problem.

**`max-iterations`**
The iteration cap was reached (default 50, overridable per card).

**`plan checklist exhausted without a DONE signal`**
The last task was ticked without the loop signalling completion — typically its
own check failed. There is nothing left to inject, so retrying the loop is not
offered; **Plan again** re-plans the remaining work on top of the branch.

**`loop blocked`**
The loop hit something outside its control — credentials or a logged-in
session it does not have, a decision only you can make — and wrote
`.ralph/BLOCKED` instead of faking completion. The blocker is on the card,
under Scoping. Answer it there if the planner needs to know something, then
**Plan again**: the planner re-plans around it on top of the work so far. The
loop runs sandboxed by design, so live access to an external service is never
something a retry can supply.

**`loop failed: …`**
The harness itself errored. Three consecutive failures end the run, and a
first-iteration connection or auth failure ends it immediately, because
retrying a misconfigured provider only spends tokens. `assistant reply exceeded
1 MiB in a single turn` means the provider's stream was corrupt (for example,
every delta re-sent the whole reply so far); the session is aborted before the
reply can overflow the context window, and the next iteration starts fresh.

**`prompt grew to Nx the run's median for two iterations`**
The context stopped coming back down. Each iteration's prompt size is compared
against the median of the run's earlier ones; one iteration far above it is
recorded as `iteration.bloat`, and two in a row end the run. Usually the loop
is re-reading more of the repo each pass without ever narrowing, which a
tighter task in the plan fixes better than a bigger budget.

**A failure the provider will repeat**
When the provider rejects the request itself — an unsupported model, a client
too old to drive it, a malformed call — the card carries the provider's own
message and the retry action for that step is withheld, because the same call
will fail the same way. Change the model under *Edit model overrides* and
restart. Separately, three failures in a row for one role on one provider and
model raise a note naming the pairing; retry still works there, since that one
is a reading rather than a certainty.

**`repo integrity violation: …`**
The parent repo changed underneath the run in a way the sandbox is supposed to
prevent. This is checked after the process group is reaped and before the
evaluator sees anything. Treat it as a containment failure worth reporting —
see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

**`install-script gate: unapproved lifecycle scripts in …`**
A dependency change introduced lifecycle scripts that have not been approved.
Nothing unapproved reaches the evaluator. Review the named packages and approve
them if they are expected.

**`disk watchdog: run is using N GB, over the M GB per-run bound` /
`disk watchdog: volume free space is N GB, under the M GB floor`**
A disk bound tripped and the run was aborted. The bounds and the ballast file
that makes the free-space floor recoverable are described in the README's
disk-limits section.

**`server restarted mid-run`**
Radulf was restarted while the run was in flight. The run is marked interrupted
and the card returns to Needs Attention; restart it.

**`worker shut down before this stage finished`**
The worker was stopped (`SIGTERM`, `docker compose restart worker`, Restart in
the app) and its drain window elapsed with this run still active. Before
exiting, the worker interrupted the run itself and handed the card back: a
checkpointed loop returns to Ready and the next worker resumes it from the
first unchecked task; a plan or evaluate run parks the card in Needs
Attention — restart it. Nothing waits for `workerStaleSeconds` here; that
window only applies when a worker dies without draining.

## Approving a merge

The merge is the one moment Radulf writes to your checkout, so it checks
preconditions first and aborts cleanly rather than leaving a half-merge.

**`target checkout <repo path> has uncommitted changes — commit or stash them there, then press Retry merge`**
The merge target must be clean. The work is not lost — clean the tree, then
press Retry merge (`POST /api/cards/:id/retry-merge`).

**`worker <id> stopped heartbeating during delivery — press Retry merge; …`**
The worker running the merge died partway through and the stale reaper parked
the card (the same message appears when a worker was stopped and its drain
window elapsed with the delivery still running — it fails its own delivery
before exiting). Press Retry merge: if the worker left its own `--no-commit` merge of
the run branch half-finished in the parent checkout (`MERGE_HEAD` set), Radulf
aborts it and merges again; if the worker had already committed the merge but
died before recording it, Radulf recognises the branch is already in the base
and records the existing merge commit (`alreadyMerged: true` in the activity's
`review.decided` payload) instead of merging twice. The pull-request delivery
has the same idempotent retry: if the earlier attempt's `gh pr create` already
succeeded, Retry merge finds the open PR for the branch and adopts it
(`alreadyOpen: true` plus its `prUrl` in the payload) instead of running
`gh pr create` again, which would fail with "a pull request for branch … already
exists".

**`a merge started outside Radulf is in progress in <repo path> (MERGE_HEAD …)`**
The parent checkout has an in-progress merge whose `MERGE_HEAD` is *not* this
card's run branch, so Radulf will not touch it. Finish or abort that merge
yourself (`git merge --continue` / `git merge --abort` in the repo), then press
Retry merge.

This is worth watching during an
[Improvement Run](IMPROVEMENT_RUNS.md#gotchas): nothing validates the tree when
the run is created, and the check only fires at the *end* of a card, so a dirty
checkout costs a full plan → loop → evaluate cycle per card and can burn the
whole budget one card at a time.

**`merge conflict — rebase needed: …`**
Recoverable — the branch is stale relative to a base that moved under it. The
card goes back to the loop to rebase rather than dead-ending.

**`cannot checkout <branch>: …` / `merge commit failed: …`**
Something in the target repo blocked the merge. The merge is aborted and your
original branch restored; the git output after the colon is the real cause.

## Improvement Runs

**`proposer ran dry`**
Three consecutive cycles produced no proposal, so the run ended early rather
than burning its remaining budget. Narrowing the focus prompt usually helps.

**`deadline reached`**
The normal ending — the time budget expired.

**Stop is not instant.** The driver only checks the clock between tasks, so a
cycle already in flight finishes first — an observed pass took 8m 42s to wind
down. See
[Improvement Runs](IMPROVEMENT_RUNS.md#stopping-deadlines-and-failure).
