# How it works

A card goes from a sentence you wrote to a merged branch by passing through
three agents. This page is the map.

```

**Scope it first, if the card is rough.** Every card carries a scoping thread
on its Task tab. An assistant that reads the card's repository, with no way to
change it, asks the questions a plan needs answered and can draft the scoped
task itself: a title and description for you to edit and apply. The planner
receives the whole thread, so decisions reached there shape the plan instead of
being retyped into the description. **Create and scope** in the New task dialog
takes a rough ask straight to that thread. Scoping is a role of its own in
Settings, separate from the planner, because you wait on every turn.

The thread can end three ways. **Draft the scoped task** rewrites this one
card. **Propose a breakdown** comes back with two or more tasks in the order
they should be done and a recommended run mode, for you to edit, reorder, drop
or add to; queueing them makes this card an epic (below). **Grill me while scoping**, on
card creation or edit, makes the questioning relentless rather than a few
questions a turn: the assistant maps the card as a design tree and asks every
question it can at once, each with a recommended answer, until nothing is left
assumed. **Let scoping write the plan** goes further and lets the session write
`PLAN.md`, `PROMPT.md` and `CRITERIA.md` itself, skipping the planner
entirely — worth it when the planner is the weakest model you have configured.
Tick **Review plan before implementation** alongside it to read the result
before anything runs.

**Epics.** A card broken down this way stays as the epic: it keeps its thread
and description, never runs itself, and its page lists the tasks under it with
their status, a progress bar, **Start all** and **Pause all**. The tasks are
ordinary cards that inherit the epic's settings and may each target another
repository. The epic's **run mode** decides how the queue treats them: **in
order** starts a task only once every task before it is done, **in
parallel** lets them all be eligible at once, and **as a graph** starts each
task once the tasks it was marked as depending on are done or abandoned — all
bounded by **Concurrent cards per repo** in Settings. In graph mode the
breakdown editor shows a **Depends on** picker per task, the breakdown
proposal suggests dependencies, a cycle is refused when you queue, and the
Work feed says what each waiting task is waiting on. **Start now** on a task
always starts it, order or dependencies notwithstanding.
The epic reads as done when its tasks are. **Create and break down** in the
New task dialog creates the card and asks for the breakdown straight away, and
a Jira issue with child issues offers those children as the tasks, ticked, with
a run mode, before the card exists.

**Jira Done comment.** A card imported from Jira keeps the issue key: the card
page shows it as a link to the issue, and `PATCH /api/cards/{id}` with `jiraKey`
sets or clears it on any card. With **Comment on Jira when a card is done** on
under **Settings → Repositories → Jira** (`jiraCommentOnDone`, off by default),
Radulf posts exactly one plain-text comment on that issue when the card reaches
Done — what became of the work, merged into the base branch at a short sha or
the pull request URL, plus the card link (`RADULF_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, or the card
id when that is unset). An epic's parent comments once when it closes, and its
pieces comment on their own keys. There is one attempt with a ~10 second
timeout, a failure never blocks the card, and the outcome appears on the card
timeline as `jira.commented` or `jira.comment_failed`. This is the only write
Radulf makes to Jira.

**1 · Plan.** The planner reads the card, its scoping thread, and the repo, then
writes plan artifacts into the worktree: a `PLAN.md`, a `PROMPT.md` for the loop
to run, and a `CRITERIA.md` holding the acceptance criteria. This is a single
invocation, and the card shows you the plan when it lands. A card the planner
finds too vague to plan gets questions instead of a guess: they land in the
scoping thread and the card goes to Needs Attention. Answer them there and
**Plan again**.

When the **plan critic** is on — by default for the tasks of a breakdown, and
for any card via its **Plan critic** setting — a read-only second model reads
the plan against the card, its thread and the specs it names before anything
runs. An approve sends the card on as usual; a revise sends the plan back to
the planner with the critic's feedback, at most twice, after which the card
goes to plan review for a person to decide. If that plan runs anyway, the
critic's last feedback goes to the evaluator to check against the change. Its
verdicts show in the card's events. A plan sent back by the critic or the acceptance pre-check returns to
the planner as written, so the planner edits it rather than starting over
(spec 32).

**2 · Loop.** The loop agent implements one task at a time inside a per-card
`git worktree`, running its targeted check each iteration. Every iteration is a
fresh context — the agent remembers nothing from the previous pass. The repo is
the memory: the plan, the progress notes, and the code already written are all
on disk. When the loop believes it is finished it writes a `DONE` signal, which
is trusted only as far as "start the evaluator" — it never sends a card to you
directly. A task it cannot do at all, because it needs credentials, a live
service, or a decision that is yours, it reports as a blocker instead of faking:
the card comes back to you with the blocker in its scoping thread, and **Plan
again** re-plans around it.

**3 · Evaluate.** The evaluator is the sole whole-card verifier, and it is
deliberately not the agent that did the work. It independently inspects the diff
and runs every acceptance criterion, then returns one of two verdicts:

- **revise** — concrete feedback, which goes back to the planner. The card
  returns to step 1: the planner writes a new plan on top of the work already on
  the branch, and the loop and evaluator run again. This can happen twice; a
  third would escalate the card to you instead of burning more budget.
- **approve** — the change is cleared and the card moves to In Review. On
  approve the evaluator also writes the card summary and refreshes any
  documentation the change made stale.

The evaluator may only write its own verdict file and documentation. If source
files or Git history change during evaluation the verdict is rejected outright,
so the judge provably cannot edit the implementation it just judged.

A repository can declare a **gate command** under Settings → Connected
repositories, `make check` for instance. Radulf runs it in the worktree, under
the run's sandbox, once the loop has signalled DONE and its branch has
been synced with the base (see *When the loop says it is done*), and hands the
evaluator the exit code and the end of the output in `.ralph/GATE.md`. A
failing gate goes back to the loop as a repair task before any evaluation
starts; the judge reads the build and test result instead of spending its
budget producing it, and a retry of the evaluator reuses the result rather than
running the gate again. **Gate timeout** under Evaluation caps it. Specs 27 and
29 record the decisions.

**4 · Review.** The diff waits for you in **In Review** with the transcript
alongside it. Approve merges the branch into the repo's default branch and moves
the card to Done. Reject sends the card back to the planner with your feedback:
it writes a new plan on top of the work already on the branch, and the card
goes through the loop and the evaluator again.

**Where the approved diff goes.** By default, approving merges the branch into
the local base branch. Turn on **Open pull requests** — per card in the New Task
dialog, or workspace-wide from the Work page's `•••` menu — and approving
instead pushes the branch to `origin` and opens a pull request against the base,
leaving the local base branch untouched. It is one or the other, never both.

This needs the GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and already authenticated: run
`gh auth login` in your terminal. Provider logins moved into Settings (spec
23) but this one did not, because Radulf drives `gh` as a foreign binary whose
login has no interface to drive, only output to read. The option is unavailable, with the reason shown, when `gh` is missing,
`gh` is logged out, or the repo has no `origin`. Before pushing, Radulf merges
the base branch in (a conflict goes back to the loop exactly as it would for a
local merge) and strips `.ralph/`, so the pull request contains what you
reviewed and not the loop's own working notes. Radulf never merges the pull
request it opens.

**Skipping step 4.** Auto-approve makes an evaluator `approve` merge straight
through, with no human in the path. It can be granted two ways: per card, from
the New Task dialog, or workspace-wide, from the **Auto-approve** toggle in the
Work page's `•••` menu. Either one is enough; the card's own flag holds even
when the workspace toggle is off. The workspace toggle is read at the moment the
evaluator returns its verdict, so turning it on applies to work already in
flight — but not to cards already sitting in In Review, which have passed that
point and stay there waiting for you. Two things are never skipped: a
`critical` finding always forces human review, and a card that exhausts the
evaluator's revision limit is always escalated to you. Pre-merge repo-integrity
and merge-conflict checks run either way.

If auto-approve and pull-request delivery are both on, the pull request is opened
as a **draft** — nobody looked at the diff, and the draft says so. A pull request
Radulf opens as ready-for-review is one a human approved.

**YOLO mode.** For leaving the queue to run overnight, the **YOLO mode** toggle
in the Work page's `•••` menu stops the pipeline asking you anything. While it
is on:

- The planner is told nobody will answer. It plans the most conservative
  reading of a vague card and writes its assumptions under `## Assumptions` in
  `PLAN.md` instead of raising questions. If it raises them anyway, it gets one
  more run to answer them itself before the card waits for you.
- The loop makes the decisions a task leaves open and says what it chose. When
  a task's check can't run because its tool is missing from the sandbox
  (`vitest: command not found`), the loop skips the check and says so. It still
  reports a blocker for work that is impossible without credentials or a live
  service. A blocked loop, or one that ticks every task without signalling
  DONE, goes straight back to the planner, as **Plan again** would, up to two
  times per card.
- **Review plan before implementation** is skipped, and a plan that reaches
  the plan critic's revision limit runs as written rather than waiting in plan
  review.
- When a criterion's tool is missing from the sandbox, the evaluator judges it
  by reading the code and adds an `important` finding naming it as unverified,
  instead of revising on that alone.

YOLO mode never merges anything. An approved card still waits in In Review
unless Auto-approve is on too. Failures that need you still go to Needs
Attention: errors, timeouts, stalls, a card past its re-plan budget, and the
install-script gate. Like Auto-approve, the toggle is read when each decision
is made, so it applies to work already in flight.

## The five agent roles

| Role | Job |
|------|-----|
| **Scoping** | Talks a rough card through with you, reading the repo read-only, and drafts the scoped task. Interactive; runs only when you ask. |
| **Planner** | Turns a card and its scoping thread into a plan, a loop prompt, and acceptance criteria. |
| **Plan critic** | Reads the finished plan against the card, its thread and the specs it names, read-only, and returns `approve` or `revise` with feedback before the loop starts (spec 30). On by default for breakdown pieces. |
| **Loop** | Implements one task at a time against the worktree, running its targeted check each iteration. |
| **Evaluator** | The sole whole-card verifier. Runs every criterion, inspects the diff, returns `approve` or `revise`, and on approve writes the summary and refreshes stale docs. |

Each role is configured independently — provider, model, and reasoning level —
on the Settings page. See [Providers and models](PROVIDERS.md).

## Card states

| State | Meaning | Moved by |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Backlog** | Written but not scheduled. Auto Mode never touches it. | You, on create |
| **Todo** | The ordered execution queue. Auto Mode pulls from here. | You |
| **In Progress** | Planning, looping, or evaluating — including revision cycles. | You start it; the orchestrator works it |
| **In Review** | An evaluator-cleared diff is waiting on your judgment. | Orchestrator |
| **Needs Attention** | Stalled, capped, errored, merge-conflicted, or waiting on your answers to the planner's questions. | Orchestrator |
| **Done** | Approved and merged. | Orchestrator, on your approval |

The orchestrator moves cards on its own as it works them. The transitions that
need a human are: Backlog → Todo (you schedule it), Needs Attention → In
Progress (you fix and restart), and the review verdict itself.

Because Needs Attention waits on you, Radulf says so rather than waiting
quietly. A card that sits there longer than **Waiting-too-long alert** (Settings
→ Notifications, 15 minutes by default) raises a `card.attention_stale` event,
once per arrival. Set an **Alert webhook URL** there and the same thing is
POSTed as JSON, which is the only alerting that reaches you without a browser
tab open — ntfy, a Slack incoming hook, a Discord webhook and a handler of your
own all take it unchanged.

Two things Radulf will tell you there rather than let you discover by repeating
them:

- **A request the provider rejected.** An unsupported model, or a client too
  old to drive one, fails the same way every time, so the card carries the
  provider's own message and offers no retry for that step. Change the model
  under *Edit model overrides* and restart.
- **A stage that keeps failing the same way.** Three failures in a row for one
  role on one provider and model says something about the pairing rather than
  about luck, and the card says which role and which model. Retry stays
  available — it is a reading, not a block.

A retry of the planner or the evaluator also knows what the attempt before it
did. Its prompt carries how that attempt ended, the model's last words, the
commands it ran with the end of each output, and for the evaluator the running
notes it kept in `.ralph/EVALUATION-NOTES.md`. Both stages are told their
budget and asked to have their result on disk well before it runs out, and a
complete verdict or plan left on disk when the watchdog fires is used rather
than thrown away. Spec 26 records the decision.

## How many cards run at once

By default, one. A single card occupies the planner, loop, or evaluator, and
the next card starts only once that slot frees. Cards waiting for a slot show a
"queued" sub-state. Different repos have always run at the same time; the cap
is per repo.

**Concurrent cards per repo** in Settings raises that, up to 8. Raise it when
the cards are independent, which is the common case: two cards editing the same
file will merge-conflict, and the loser is handed back to its own loop to
rebase. The setting is held at 1 while the loop provider is local, because a
local model wants the whole machine's unified memory, which is the actual
reason the queue was serial to begin with.

While a card is looping you can **pause** it — the current iteration finishes
and then the card waits — and **continue** it later, optionally after changing
its per-card model overrides so that resumed iterations run differently. A
paused run is recorded as paused, not completed, so stopping work yourself
never counts for or against the success rate in Activity.

## When the loop says it is done

DONE is the loop agent's own claim, and an evaluation is the most expensive
thing the pipeline does, so Radulf checks the cheap part first. Any shell
commands your acceptance criteria wrote in backticks are run in the worktree,
and a command that exits non-zero buys the loop one more iteration to fix what
it found before the evaluator is started.

Only failures count. A criterion can carry a judgment a shell cannot make
("returns at least 3 wrapper scripts"), so passing proves nothing and the
evaluator still decides. Only check-shaped commands run — `test`, `grep`,
`find`, `ls` and their kin — and anything else in backticks is left alone. The
repair pass happens at most once per run, because a criterion can be written so
that it can never pass.

The same commands are also run the other way round, before the loop exists. Once
the planner finishes, its check commands are run against the worktree nobody has
touched yet, and one that already exits the way its criterion wants cannot show
that this card's work got done — it would report the same thing had the loop
changed nothing. Those commands are listed in an `acceptance.precheck` event on
the card's timeline, and the plan goes back to the planner once, sharing the plan
critic's two-revision cap so the two cannot ping-pong a card. A plan that comes
back with such a check still in it ships as written: the card proceeds, and if
that check fails after DONE the failure is reported on the timeline but buys no
repair iteration — the loop would spend its one repair pass making a tautology
pass. Checks under a `## Regression` heading in `CRITERIA.md` are skipped by the
pre-check, since of course they pass now, and are probed after DONE like every
other criterion. None of this moves the asymmetry: a zero exit still proves
nothing. Spec 31 records the decision.

Once those checks pass, the orchestrator merges the base branch into the
worktree, so the evaluator judges the code that will actually land. A clean
merge becomes a merge commit on the run branch; a conflict becomes one more task
for the loop, naming the conflicted files, and the loop's next completion signal
lets the orchestrator finish the merge commit. The loop agent never runs git
itself, and the base branch is only read, once any approval merge in flight for
the repository has finished. Then, if the repository has a gate command, the
gate runs; a non-zero exit is another task quoting the end of its output.
Evaluation starts only once the branch is synced and the gate passes (or the
repository has none). A run gets at most two such sync-or-gate rounds; a third
conflict or gate failure ends the run with the reason on the card. Spec 29
records the decision.

## Where the work happens

```
data/                            gitignored; the sandbox denies it wholesale
  radulf.db                      the SQLite database
  pi-agent/auth.json             your provider credentials, held by pi
  transcripts/<run>/             normalized per-iteration transcripts
worktrees/<card>-<run>/          a git worktree on branch ralph/<card>-<run>
plans/<run>/                     the planner's writable output
```

Worktrees and plans sit *beside* `data/`, not inside it, and that is load-bearing
rather than cosmetic: the sandbox policy is a flat "deny `data/`" with no
carve-out, which only works if nothing an agent must write lives under it. Both
locations are overridable — `RADULF_WORKTREES_DIR` and `RADULF_PLANS_DIR`, with
`RADULF_DATA_DIR` for the rest.

Worktrees are created and removed by the orchestrator only, never by an agent.
Your registered checkout is written exactly once per card — the `--no-ff` merge
on approval — and that merge is unsandboxed, trusted server code that re-verifies
repo integrity immediately before it runs.

The `ralph/` branch namespace is Radulf's own, and the New Task branch picker
never offers one of those branches as a base: a run branch is checked out in
its worktree, so the merge on approval could not check it out. Removing a
repository in Settings removes its cards' worktrees and run branches along with
their records, so nothing of the kind is left behind to pick.

For what constrains the agents while they work, see [Sandboxing](SANDBOXING.md).
