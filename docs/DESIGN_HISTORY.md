# Design history

Radulf's `specs/` directory is a **dated decision log**, not documentation. Each
spec records what was decided, when, and why — including decisions that have
since been overturned by later specs. It is genuinely useful if you want to know
*why* something is the way it is, and actively misleading if you read it as a
description of how Radulf works today.

**If you want to know how Radulf works, read the guides instead** — start with
[How it works](HOW_IT_WORKS.md). The specs are kept honest about their own
history rather than rewritten, so nothing here is edited to match the present.

## Read this first

Several specs are superseded. The harness design in particular was decided three
times:

```
   09 multi-harness  ──▶  12 pi-harness  ──▶  13 single-pi-sdk-harness
   (a harness per         (pi added as a      (one harness for every
    provider)              fourth harness)     provider — what ships)
```

Reading 09 on its own will tell you that the loop harness follows the provider —
that Claude runs claude-code and oMLX runs opencode. That has not been true
since spec 13 consolidated everything onto pi in SDK mode. Likewise, spec 14
re-amended the permissions posture from "worktree plus prompt guardrails" to
kernel-enforced containment.

The current state of any decision is best read from the guides, or from the
"Locked decisions" list in `00-overview` — which carries its own amendment
history inline.

| [25: Web and worker processes](../specs/25-web-and-worker-processes.md) | Splitting the one process into web and worker roles that share the database, so a web restart ends no run, several of each can run on one host, and a session crash stays in its worker | Current; amends 02's process model, 13's hosting note, and 20's process-wide analysis |
| [26: Retries inherit the failed attempt](../specs/26-retries-inherit-the-failed-attempt.md) | Forwarding a killed planner or evaluator attempt's notes, transcript digest, and drafts into its retry, a deadline in the prompt, and honouring a complete result left on disk at a timeout | Current; extends 18 |

| [29: Sync with base and gate before evaluation](../specs/29-sync-and-gate-before-evaluation.md) | Merging the base branch into a finished loop's worktree and running the repository gate before evaluation, with conflicts and gate failures handed back to the loop as tasks, bounded to two rounds | Current; extends 18 item 7 and 27 |
| [30: A plan critic between planning and the loop](../specs/30-plan-critic.md) | A read-only critic run that reviews each plan against the card, the thread and the specs before the loop starts, approving or sending it back to the planner with feedback, at most twice | Current; extends 04's roles and 17; revision cap shared with 31; decision 2 amended by 32 |
| [31: Probe acceptance checks against the untouched worktree](../specs/31-acceptance-precheck.md) | Running a plan's check commands before the loop starts, sending back once a plan whose new-behavior checks already pass, and never spending a repair iteration on such a check after DONE | Current; extends 18 item 7 and 30; decision 3 amended by 32 |
| [32: Revise the plan in place](../specs/32-revise-the-plan-in-place.md) | Handing the planner its previous plan when the critic or the pre-check sends it back, so a revision edits the plan instead of re-planning from nothing | Current; amends 30 decision 2 and 31 decision 3 |

## Implementation plans

`docs/` also held two implementation plans — checklists with a finish line
rather than reference material — for spec 14's sandboxing work and for
Improvement Runs. Both were completed and removed from the tree; they remain in
git history if you want the phasing or the progress log that recorded the two
bugs the live Improvement Runs exposed.

What they built is documented in [Sandboxing](SANDBOXING.md) and
[Improvement Runs](IMPROVEMENT_RUNS.md).

## The locked decisions

A handful of decisions were made at the outset and are treated as fixed unless
explicitly revisited: the task domain (coding tasks against local Git repos),
the stack, a metered pipeline (one card at a time until you raise it, and
always one on a local model), in-app diff review, and — the
one that matters most — **merging always requires human approval**. No version
of Radulf merges on its own without an explicit opt-in design.

The full list, with each amendment dated, is in
[`00-overview`](../specs/00-overview.md#locked-decisions).
