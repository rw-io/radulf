You are working on: making the stale delivery reaper in src/server/orchestrator.ts finish a dead worker's review delivery as landed (ok=1, `recoveredAfterWorkerLoss`) when its card is already `done`, and renaming/widening `removeAbandonedWorktrees` in src/server/retention.ts to `removeFinishedWorktrees` so it reclaims the worktree, `ralph/*` branch and integrity baseline of every `done`/`abandoned` card.

Your task for this iteration is given in the `## Your assigned task` block at
the top of this prompt, together with a LAST_TASK=true|false flag. That block
is your ONLY task source — there is no task list to find or update; the
orchestrator tracks completion and makes all commits.

Do exactly that ONE task this iteration — nothing else:
1. Do the task. Verify it worked: run the check named in the task (if any)
   and confirm `git status` shows the files you edited. Never claim a task
   whose edits you did not make in THIS session — the orchestrator rejects
   completions that changed nothing.
2. Write a short summary (one or two lines) of what you did into
   `.ralph/ITERATION_DONE` — this signals the orchestrator to record
   completion and commit your work.
3. If LAST_TASK=false, STOP NOW. Do not start anything else — the next
   iteration will handle it.

Only if LAST_TASK=true: after your task-specific check passes and you write
`.ralph/ITERATION_DONE`, write a short bulleted TLDR into `.ralph/DONE` (a
one-line header summarizing the change, followed by a few `- ` bullets
covering what changed, why, and key files) and stop. Whole-card acceptance
testing is the evaluator's job, not yours. Never write `.ralph/DONE` if the
task-specific check failed or when LAST_TASK=false.

Rules: never run `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout`, `git switch`,
`git push`, or any other git command that changes state. The orchestrator
commits for you, and the worktree must stay on the branch it was given.
Read-only commands like `git status` and `git diff` are fine. Never modify
`.ralph/PROMPT.md`; never touch files outside this working directory; only run
tests that cover your current task's files — NEVER run the full test suite.
Your assigned task is the ONLY task: never create or update any harness
todo list (e.g. the todowrite tool).
Batch independent reads/searches into a single turn instead of issuing
them sequentially.
Do not re-read a file after editing it unless a check fails or the edit tool
reports ambiguity.

Hints for this repository:
- TypeScript + drizzle-orm on SQLite; tests are vitest (`npx vitest run <file>`). Tests use `await import(...)` after `setupTestDataDir(...)` — keep new imports in that same awaited-import style in test files.
- `FINISHED_STATUSES` (src/server/epics.ts) is a `readonly CardStatus[]`; when passing it to drizzle's `inArray`, spread it: `inArray(cards.status, [...FINISHED_STATUSES])`.
- `getCard` and `emitEvent` are already imported in src/server/orchestrator.ts; the `reviews` table is exported from `@/db` (src/db/schema.ts) but must be added to orchestrator.ts's `@/db` import list if you use it.
- ESLint fails on unused imports; remove any import you stop using.
- Do not touch files under `.ralph/` other than `.ralph/ITERATION_DONE` (and `.ralph/DONE` when LAST_TASK=true).
