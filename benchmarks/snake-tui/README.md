# Snake TUI Benchmark Fixture

A repeatable benchmark fixture for Radulf Phase 3 loop-performance testing.
The task is **"Create snake in a Python TUI"** — a medium greenfield build
starting from an empty repo.

## Preconditions

Before running a benchmark, ensure the following are in place:

1. **A running Radulf server** accessible at a base URL (default
   `http://localhost:3000`).
2. **A registered empty git repo** with an initial commit.  Use the
   Radulf UI or API to register a repo pointing to an empty (or minimal)
   git worktree on disk.  The repo must have at least one commit on its
   default branch.
3. **Candidate providers configured** in Radulf Settings (Planner Provider
   and Loop Provider). The runner accepts `--model` and `--planner-model`
   overrides that are passed as the card's `loopModel` and `plannerModel`.
4. **Authentication credentials** — either a session cookie value
   (`RADULF_BENCH_AUTH_COOKIE`, or `--auth-cookie`) or the server's auth
   password (`--password`).  If `--password` is used, the runner logs in via
   `POST /api/auth/login` and reads the `Set-Cookie` header automatically.
   Prefer the environment variable: a benchmark runs for hours, and a
   process's command line is readable by every account on the host for that
   whole time.  Launching from the Benchmarks page always uses it.  Pass
   neither when the server runs with auth disabled (no
   `RADULF_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`).

## Usage

The runner is shared by every fixture and lives at
`benchmarks/run-benchmark.mjs` (see `benchmarks/README.md`):

```
node benchmarks/run-benchmark.mjs --fixture snake-tui [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--fixture` | *(required)* | Fixture directory name — `snake-tui` here |
| `--base-url` | `http://localhost:3000` | Radulf server base URL |
| `--repo` | *(required)* | Registered throwaway-repo ID |
| `--provider` | *(required)* | Loop provider name (e.g. `anthropic`, `openrouter`) |
| `--model` | *(required)* | Loop model name (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `--planner-model` | loop model | Planner model name; uses the planner provider from Settings |
| `--evaluator-model` | Settings | Evaluator model name; uses the evaluator provider from Settings |
| `--critic-model` | Settings | Plan critic model name; uses the critic provider from Settings |
| `--plan-critic` | Settings | `on` or `off`; Settings' default `breakdown` mode skips the critic for a benchmark card |
| `--runs` | `3` | Number of benchmark runs |
| `--auth-cookie` | `$RADULF_BENCH_AUTH_COOKIE` | Session cookie value for authentication |
| `--password` | — | Password to POST `/api/auth/login` and read `Set-Cookie` |
| `--max-iterations` | *(default)* | Optional card `maxIterations` override |
| `--timeout-minutes` | *(default)* | Optional card `timeoutMinutes` override |
| `--auto-review` | off | Automatically approve/reject based on criteria pass |
| `--out` | *(stdout)* | Path to write the JSON report |
| `--dry-run` | off | Validate arguments, print the plan, exit 0 — no API calls |
| `--help` | — | Show usage and exit |

### Example

```bash
# Dry run — validate arguments and print the execution plan
node benchmarks/run-benchmark.mjs \
  --fixture snake-tui \
  --repo my-throwaway-repo \
  --provider anthropic \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
  --planner-model claude-opus-4-20250514 \
  --password 'my-radulf-password' \
  --runs 3 \
  --out benchmarks/reports/snake-tui-2026-07-15.json \
  --dry-run

# Real run — drop --dry-run
```

## Metrics Collected

For each run the runner records:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Criteria pass** | Boolean — all CRITERIA.md commands exit 0 |
| **Diff correctness** | Boolean — non-empty diff AND criteria pass |
| **Total wall time** | `run.endedAt − run.startedAt` (ms) |
| **Iterations** | Number of iterations completed |
| **Model turns** | Sum of `iteration.modelTurns` across all iterations |
| **p50 iteration time** | Median iteration wall time (ms) |
| **p90 iteration time** | 90th percentile iteration wall time (ms) |
| **Uncached input tokens** | Sum of `iteration.promptTokens` |
| **Cached input tokens** | Sum of `iteration.cachedInputTokens` |
| **Output tokens** | Sum of `iteration.completionTokens` |
| **Reasoning tokens** | Sum of `iteration.reasoningTokens` |
| **Cost (USD)** | Sum of `iteration.costUsd` |
| **Review outcome** | `"pending"` if card is in `review`, otherwise the terminal status |

After all runs, the report aggregates across runs with min, max, median, p50,
p90, and mean for each numeric metric.  Criteria pass rate and diff
correctness rate are also reported.

## Parallel Loops

During a benchmark run, the runner **disables parallel loops** by setting
`maxParallelLoops: 1` via `PATCH /api/settings`.  The prior value is saved
and restored in a `finally` block, even if the runner encounters an error.
This ensures that concurrency does not mask per-loop latency or
rate-limiting effects.

## The Rest of the Corpus

This fixture covers the greenfield case. The existing-codebase fixtures live
alongside it — `small-ui-change`, `server-data-change`, and
`failing-test-repair` — see `benchmarks/README.md`. Promotion decisions
should weigh results across the whole corpus, not just this fixture.
