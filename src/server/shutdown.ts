// it does for a hard crash today; the value-add here is only the common case
// (idle, or between iterations) exiting cleanly instead of relying on that
// crash-recovery path every time.
//
// Only effective with NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE=1 in the environment (the
// Makefile's `start` target and the Dockerfile set it): otherwise `next
// start` installs its own SIGTERM/SIGINT handler that exits with 143/130 as
// soon as open connections close, which is milliseconds when no browser tab
// or SSE stream is attached, and this drain never gets to run. That caveat
// applies only under `next start`: a plain Node worker process
// (src/worker.ts) installs these handlers directly and drains on SIGTERM
// as-is.
