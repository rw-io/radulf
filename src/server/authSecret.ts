/**
 * Node-only: ensure the HMAC auth secret exists on disk and in the process env.
 *
 * Reads `<DATA_DIR>/auth-secret` if present; otherwise generates 32 random
 * bytes (hex) via `node:crypto`, writes it to disk (creating the dir if
 * needed), and mirrors the value into `process.env.RADULF_AUTH_SECRET` so the
 * edge-safe session helpers in `session.ts` can read it at request time.
 *
 * Called from `src/server/boot.ts` for both the `web` and `worker` roles, so
 * the secret is available before any requests or jobs arrive. The two roles
 * may boot as separate processes at the same instant, so creation is an
 * exclusive create (`wx`) with a re-read on collision rather than an
 * exists-then-write race that would leave the two processes with different
 * secrets (spec 25 decision 8).
