# Turbopack roots the project at this checkout and refuses any symlink that

# that looks free in a `git worktree add` checkout, where the directory does not
# exist until something installs it — therefore dies minutes into the build
# with `Symlink [project]/node_modules is invalid, it points out of the
# filesystem root`, while test, lint and typecheck follow the link happily and
# only the build breaks. Check the directory instead, and name the fix
# (`make install` gives the checkout its own dependencies).
#
# It has to be a prerequisite, not a recipe line at the top of `build`: recipe
# lines run only after every prerequisite, so the first thing to touch the bad
# link — `build-worker`'s esbuild — would still run, and `make check` would
# still burn the whole vitest pass before finding out. Listing it first in
